# FFX-X2_LAUNCHER
*Launcher with Gamepad support for FINAL FANTASY X/X-2 HD Remaster (PC)*
--------------------------------

Gamepad and mouse support.<br />
Build with NW.js (http://nwjs.io/)<br />

Download: https://github.com/xan105/FFX-X2_LAUNCHER/releases/tag/v1.0 <br/>
Mirror Download link: http://download.xan105.com/app/FFX&X-2_LAUNCHER.exe

I can't guarantee that it will work with every gamepad that exist but as long as yours support xinput you are in the green i guess. It works great with my Logitech F310 ^-^.

If you have UnX installed it will display more configuration option in the setting screen.<br /> 
(see https://steamcommunity.com/app/359870/discussions/0/364041517007524857/)<br /> 
NB: ```UnX.ini``` needs to be re-encoded to utf-8 for this to work.<br />
NB2: Launcher needs admin right to save settings in ```UnX.ini``` if ```UnX.ini``` is in a protected folder (eg: **C:\Program Files**\Steam\FFX-X2\)<br />
NB3: Last tested with UnX v0.0.4<br />
