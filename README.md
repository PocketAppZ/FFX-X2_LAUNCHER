# FFX-X2_LAUNCHER
*Launcher with Gamepad support for FINAL FANTASY X/X-2 HD Remaster (PC)*
--------------------------------

'Remake' of the official launcher with Gamepad and mouse support

If you have UnX installed it will display more configuration option in the setting screen. (see [https://steamcommunity.com/app/359870/discussions/0/364041517007524857/]) 
NB: UnX.ini needs to be re-encoded to utf-8 for this to work.<br />
NB2: Launcher needs admin right if ```UnX.ini``` is in a protected folder (eg: ```**C:\Program Files**\Steam\FFX-X2\```)<br />
NB3: Last tested with v0.0.4<br />
